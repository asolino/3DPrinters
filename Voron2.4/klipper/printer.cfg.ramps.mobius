# VORON2 250mm config

# This is a base printer.cfg file for the VORON2 printer and matches the manual/build guide exactly
# for controllers used (dual RAMPS) and pin layout for all connected components.
# Created by "Boff" with help from the VORON community.

# For other build sizes, controllers, or non-standard pin connections, please see
# https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/tree/master/firmware/klipper/configurations
# for other example Klipper configs created by the VORON community.

# This file is only an example - be sure to review and update it
# according to the specifics of your printer. See the example.cfg and
# example-extras.cfg files for a description of available Klipper parameters.

pressure_advance: 0

#   advance.
pressure_advance_lookahead_time: 0.010
#   A time (in seconds) to "look ahead" at future extrusion moves when
#   calculating pressure advance. This is used to reduce the
#   application of pressure advance during cornering moves that would
#   otherwise cause retraction followed immediately by pressure
#   buildup. This setting only applies if pressure_advance is

[probe]
# Inductive Probe
# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and

# may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian
# style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop.

#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
samples: 2
#   Number of times to probe a point
sample_retract_dist: 3.0
#   How far to retract (in mm) from the probe point for multi-probe samples
samples_result: average
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
#samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
#samples_tolerance_retries: 0
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.

[fan]
# Print cooling fan
pin: ar9
#   D9 on mcu_xye
max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully
#   enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the
#   pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This setting may
#   be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to
#   the fan. If this value is less than 1.0 then fan speed requests
#   will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if
#   max_power is .9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested then the fan
#   power will be set to 72%). The default is 1.0.
shutdown_speed: 0
#   The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if
#   the micro-controller software enters an error state. The default
#   is 0.
cycle_time: 0.010
#   The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the
#   fan. It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when
#   using software based PWM. The default is 0.010 seconds.
hardware_pwm: false
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. The
#   default is False.
kick_start_time: 0.500
#   Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when first enabling
#   it (helps get the fan spinning). The default is 0.100 seconds.
#   See the "fan" section in example.cfg for a description of the
#   above parameters.

idle_speed: 0.4
#   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
#   will be set to when a heater or stepper driver was active and before
#   the idle_timeout is reached. This must be greater or equal
#   max_power. The default is max_power
heater: extruder,heater_bed
#   Name of the config section defining the heater that this fan is
#   associated with. If a comma separated list of heater names is

# sensor_pin: analog15
# min_temp: 0
# max_temp: 100
# #   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
# #   sensor must remain within. This controls a safety feature
# #   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
# #   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
# #   will go into a shutdown state. Set this range just wide enough so
# #   that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error. These
# #   parameters must be provided.
# target_temp: 50
# #   A temperature (in Celsius) that will be the target temperature.
# #   The default is 40 degrees.
# max_speed: 1.0
# #   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
# #   will be set to when the sensor temperature exceeds the set value.
# #   The default is 1.0.
# min_speed: 0

[verify_heater heater_bed]
max_error: 120
#   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
#   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
#   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
#   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
#   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
#   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
#   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
#   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
#   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
#   120.
check_gain_time: 60
#   This controls heater verification during initial heating.  Smaller
#   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
#   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
#   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
#   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
#   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
#   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
hysteresis: 5
#   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
#   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
#   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 5.
heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by during the check_gain_time check. It is rare to customize this
